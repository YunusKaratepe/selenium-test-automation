# Selenium Test Automation
- Tests are in the src/test/java/OrderedTests.java file.
- HomePage and LoginPage which are in the same directory is used for interacting WebElements using ChromeDriver.
- Also theres a MyLogger.java file in the src/main/java/ directory used for Logging.

- NOTE: This was my first try about test automations.
